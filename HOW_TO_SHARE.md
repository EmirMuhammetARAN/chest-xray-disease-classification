# How to share this project on GitHub & LinkedIn

Below are ready-to-use assets and copy you can use when publishing the project on GitHub and posting on LinkedIn to attract recruiters.

## Short project blurb (for README / GitHub description)
"Multi-label chest X‑ray disease classification using EfficientNetB0. Trained on NIH ChestX‑ray14 to detect 15 thoracic findings. Includes demo scripts, Grad‑CAM visualizations, and pre-trained weights for easy evaluation. Research-only (not for clinical use)."

## LinkedIn post (copy & paste)
Headline: "Project: Multi‑label Chest X‑ray Disease Classifier — EfficientNetB0 + Grad‑CAM"

Post:

> I built a multi-label chest X‑ray disease classifier (EfficientNetB0) that detects 15 thoracic findings (e.g., edema, effusion, pneumothorax). The project focuses on engineering reproducibility, explainability (Grad‑CAM), and practical deployment (Gradio demo + Dockerfile).
>
> Why this matters: radiology workloads are high and screening tools can help flag studies for radiologist review — this is a research prototype, not a clinical tool.
>
> Repo: https://github.com/EmirMuhammetARAN/chest-xray-disease-classification
>
> If you're hiring ML engineers or research interns and want to see the code and demo, I’d love to connect. Open to roles in ML engineering and medical imaging.

## Suggested visuals
- Screenshot of the Gradio app showing predictions + Grad‑CAM outputs.
- A short GIF (3–8s) showing: upload image → predictions → Grad‑CAM panel.
- A tile image with repo title, short tagline, and your GitHub handle.

## What to attach
- Link to repo (use the main repo URL)
- Link to Hugging Face Space (if deployed)
- Optionally: link to a Google Colab that runs demo without local setup

## Quick checklist before posting
- Ensure `README.md` top has a concise one-line summary visible in the repo preview.
- Add one or two screenshots to the repo (e.g., `images/demo_screenshot.png`) and reference them in the README.
- Confirm LICENSE is present (MIT). Add contributor / contact info.

Good luck — if you want, I can generate the LinkedIn-ready screenshot markup (HTML) or produce a short GIF script recommendation you can run locally to capture the demo.
